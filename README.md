## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- First of all, I tried to make the html more semantic. I used some tags I had never used before, such as <code>article</code>, <code>blockquote</code>, and <code>cite</code>. I think it can be useful while creating complicate website! So I will keep learning more about it and figure how to better the code and make it even more simpler. (Because I still ended up using serval <code>div</code>).

### Continued development

- The CSS code is a bit messy. I would like to make it simpler. 
- I will try to figure out how to make the bottom of the first review box stays higher than the second one while the second one is also higher than the third one.
